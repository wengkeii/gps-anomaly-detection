Anomaly Dectection In Trajectories Using GPS Data

Problem Statement:

To develop an algorithm for detecting anomalies in trajectories using the Microsoft Geolife GPS dataset. The algorithm aims to identify deviations from users' typical travel patterns across various transportation modes such as car, bus, bike, train and walking. Anomalies to be detected include unexpected travel locations between start and end points and significant variations in speed or travel duration. The objective of this project is to enhance understanding of individual travel behaviors and enable early detection of irregularities for further investigation.
